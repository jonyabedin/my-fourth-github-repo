    <h2>Natural Beauty of Bangladesh </h2>
    <p>Bangladesh is a very beautiful country with many rivers, green fields, big
         forests, and lovely hills. The rivers like Padma and Jamuna make the land 
         rich for farming. The Sundarbans is a famous forest where the Royal Bengal
          Tiger lives. In Sylhet, there are green tea gardens, and Cox’s Bazar is the
           longest sea beach in the world. Many birds, animals, and flowers can be 
           seen everywhere. The villages look nice with many trees and ponds. All 
           these things make Bangladesh special. We should take care of our country’s 
           nature so it stays beautiful forever.
